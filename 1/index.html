    <p>Two households, both alike in dignity
      <p>In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
        <p>From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
          <p>Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean
            <p>From forth the fatai loins of these two foes
              <p>A pair of star-cross'd lovers take the r life,
                <p>Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
                  <p>Do with their death bury their parents strife
                    <p>The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
                      <p>And the continuance of their parents' rage,
                        <p>Which, but their children's end, nought couid remove,
                          <p>Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage
                            <p>The which if you with patient ears attend.
                              <p>What here shail miss, our toil shal strive to mend.</p>
